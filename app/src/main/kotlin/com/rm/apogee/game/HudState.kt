 * Deliberately a plain class rather than state hoisted up through composables:
 * the writers are the frame-clock loop, the game session and touch handlers,
 * all of which are ordinary non-composable Kotlin that needs a plain reference
 * to write into. Compose observes; the game does not have to become Compose to
 * talk to it.
